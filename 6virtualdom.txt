Hello here we learn about virtual dom 


Virtual Dom - if there is a variable a which is update every second then we have power that 
              we direct reflect changes of third change rather than updating one by one


Createroot()method - it's create tree of dom and compare it with browsers tree 
                     whenever the changes are done it's only compare and change element which is updated .
                     rendering or refreshing is easier with that.
